# calcr
A simple calculator made in Rust.

### What it can
It can handle **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication** and **division**, and it comes with three constants, `pi`, `e` and `tau`.

### What it can't
Operators like `^` and `!` are still work in progress, and also custom variables will be added shortly. First thing that is going to be added are commands, and they will be accessible with the `\` special character.
